            <h1>What is Panoptilog?</h1>

            <p>Panoptilog is a portmanteau of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon">panopticon</a>
            and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logging_(computing)">log</a>. It was inspired
            by DARPA's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_LifeLog">lifelog</a> project.</p>

            <p>The allusions to surveillance tools are somewhat tongue-in-cheek. My intentions
            with this project are to enable myself to automatically journal and analyze
            data on my own life. However, I want to acknowledge that the software I'm
            building ultimately do amount to surveillance tools, albeit for
            self-surveillance. A journal isn't spyware if one is introspecting, but an
            automated journal -- wherein one is <em>externally observed</em> -- can be construed
            as such even if the person observed has sole control over that data. Thus, I
            named the project as I did lest I get too comfortable with that idea.</p>

            <p>At present, we leave behind a digital trail every time we open an
            internet-connected device. This personal data is not intrinsically valuable;
            rather, its sensitivity lies in the fact that knowledge of someone is power
            over that person. Private companies are interested in leveraging this digital
            trail to manipulate our purchasing decisions. Governments are interested in it
            to get a tighter hold over their citizens.</p>

            <p>What if we retained such a log on ourselves? A near-complete record of our own
            digital trail: one that can be indexed and searched <strong>privately</strong> for our own
            personal discovery and enrichment. If leaving a digital footprint is
            inevitable, then we should at least have equal access to that level of insight
            into our own lives.</p>
