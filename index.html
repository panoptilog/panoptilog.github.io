            <h1>What is Panoptilog?</h1>

            <p>Panoptilog is a portmanteau of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon" target="_blank">panopticon</a>
            and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logging_(computing)" target="_blank">log</a>. It was inspired
            by DARPA's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_LifeLog" target="_blank">lifelog</a> project.</p>

            <p>The allusions to surveillance tools are somewhat tongue-in-cheek. My intentions
            with this project are to enable myself to automatically journal and analyze
            data on my own life. However, I want to acknowledge that the software I'm
            building ultimately do amount to surveillance tools, albeit for
            self-surveillance. A journal isn't spyware if one is introspecting, but an
            automated journal -- wherein one is <em>externally observed</em> -- can be construed
            as such even if the person observed has sole control over that data. Thus, I
            named the project what I did lest I get too comfortable with that idea.</p>

            <p>Personal data is not intrinsically valuable; rather, its worth lies in the fact that
            knowledge of one's private life translates to power over that person. At present, we leave
            behind a digital trail every time we open an internet-connected device. Many for-profit companies
            are interested in exploiting this trail to influence consumer spending. Many governments are
            interested in it to gain leverage over their adversaries.</p>

            <p>What if we retained such logs on ourselves? A near-complete record of our own
            digital trail: one that can be indexed and searched <strong>privately</strong> for our own
            personal discovery and enrichment. There is an assymmetry in data analysis capabilities between
            individuals and service providers. Panoptilog seeks to lessen this gap. If leaving digital
            footprints is inevitable, then individuals should at least have equal ability to journal and
            draw insights from their own data.</p>
